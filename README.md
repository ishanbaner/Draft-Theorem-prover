# Draft-Theorem-prover
A simple prototype of a theorem prover.

It's a simple and basic structure of a theorem prover that deals with first-order logic. 
Expressions can be plugged in with the help of the solver method. 
A few examples can be found in main.py.

Significant improvements are needed but it's a very basic prottype.
Currently, it lacks important expressions like "for all" and "exists".
